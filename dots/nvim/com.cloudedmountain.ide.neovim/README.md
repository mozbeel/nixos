# Unity Neovim Code Editor

Make Neovim a Unity first-class citizen!

## Goals of this project

- Integrate neovim with unity as external script editor
  - Neovim can be selected as external script editor
  - Files of appropriate type will be opened in neovim
    - Opening a file without existing neovim instance opens a new neovim instance
    - Opening a file with existing neovim instance opens the file in the existing neovim instance
  - .NET based unity solution files will be synced if necessary (new file added, file deleted, file renamed)
  - Manually trigger unity solution files synchronization via assets menu

### Out of scope

- Unity integration in neovim
  - Syntax highlighting, code completion and further C# specific features are provided via [neovim's language server capabilities](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).
  - [omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn) is the way to go

## Current state of the project

The project currently is in early stage development. Expect errors and breaking changes.
The current version `0.0.1` was tested on Arch Linux only. The project currently does not support operating systems other than linux.

## Installation

1. Download

```
git clone git@github.com:Domeee/com.cloudedmountain.ide.neovim.git
```

```

3. Set neovim as external script edtior

4. Start an nvim server

nvim --listen /tmp/nvimsocket
```

## Usage

The neovim unity package automatically synchronizes the unity solution files if a new file was added, an existing file was deleted or renamed.

## Todo list

- [ ] Streamline installation process
- [x] Replace `neovim-remote` dependency asap, see [GitHub PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17439)

## Troubleshooting
